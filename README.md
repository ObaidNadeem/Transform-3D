Using 3D transforms properties can be tricky sometimes. We often cannot calculate in our mind where the element will ascend or descend into 3D space. For which I have created the transform 3D visualizer, where we can pass different 3D values to visualize the position of element in 3D space before using it in the final build.

If anyone could add the layers feature then that'll be great because I am already occupied with clients animations a lot.

Contribute to the project! :D

This is surely nothing much just a simple 3D visualizer which I use always for my help with 3D transforms, tho I have bigger plans with this will reaveal them sometimes later!
